## Interact

An additional part of the modification. Interacts with the game's API automatically (so you **may be banned** for using them, be careful)

All interactions use a general timer, configurable in the settings (500ms by default). Values ​​below **250ms** will often lead to temporary blocking from servers, so I don't recommend it.

Completely disabled by default.
